Tic-Tac-Toe using React.js
===========================
This project uses Reacts [Tic Tac Toe Tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)
as a starter template.
Which I will later  uses a basis for integrating some features into my [Binary Tic Tac Toe App](https://github.com/StaceyWhitmore/BinaryTicTacToe)--
written in vanillaJS, it uses a bitwise comparison to determine a winner to add
history functionality by accessing React's state obj.
